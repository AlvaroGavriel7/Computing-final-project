    <p1>Conclusion</p1>
    <p>Besides giving consequences, the school also gives mentoring to guide and support students who make mistakes.

Mentoring can include:
<ul>
<li>Regular check-ins with the Vice Principal of Student Affairs</li>

<li>Guidance from the homeroom teacher or counselor</li>

<li>The point of mentoring is to help students learn, grow, and make better choices next time.</li>

In the end, Chapter 5 reminds us that discipline can make us learn to become better person.</p>
